# Intro

Just a place for me to chuck in any useful JavaScript codes / templates runnable via [CoderPad](https://cpad.io/).

My first bit of template code `coderPadTDDSuite.js` aims to facilitate TDD (Test Driven Development) via the Mocha and Chai Library. (Underscore library is also used to take advantage of some funcation programming feature).
